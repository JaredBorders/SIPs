## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to incorporate the following into Perps V3:
- Incorporate a `getOpenPositionSize` that returns the size of a open position given a market id and account number as input
- Emit an event when an account is flagged for liquidation
- Incorporate a view function that returns the settlement keeping costs plus the settlement reward

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

- `getOpenPositionSize` would be a view function that reads on the storage slot that holds the keepers position information given a certain `marektId` as input as done [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/PerpsAccountModule.sol#L111C1-L114C1)

- A event emitted under right after an account is flagged for [liquidation](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/LiquidationModule.sol#L54) which includes the following information:

a) availableMargin

b) requiredMaintenanceMargin

c) liquidationReward

d) account id


- Create a view functions that takes in the settlement strategy id and returns the [keeping cost](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/AsyncOrder.sol#L313C1-L315C1) associated with an async order. The keeping costs includes the keeper reward as well as the relevant gas costs.

## Motivation

- Currently in order to be able to retrieve open positions a pyth price update might be required. However market makers requested that a function be available that is able to query the state of positions without the need for a pyth price update, as a fallback against pythnet being in a non-operational state.
- Integrators requested that conditions that result in an account being flagged for liquidation be emitted upon flag.
- Integrators looking to show the user the costs of executing a trade need this function. Currently there is a workaround by querying the node with a given argument, however, it is unclean especially in situations where the node configuration is modified.
