## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:
- Drop the [`getReportedDebt`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L301) from the event emitted upon withdrawing sUSD from a given perp market.
- Requiring that traders, upon committing to a new order, update the stale prices of all the collaterals configured in the super market where the order is sent.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `getReportedDebt` function requires that all the market prices, in a given supermarket, be not stale. This can be problematic for large supermarkets, as the cost of updating the prices of many markets, that don't exhibit much trading activity, can be significant.

- Upon settlement of a trade, the `getDepositedCollateralValue` function is called [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L300C24-L300C51) and [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L75). This function checks that all configured collaterals to a given perp super market have fresh prices. In order to ensure that trade settlement keepers, continue to be properly incentivized to execute a pending order, the prices of all collaterals need to be not stale at settlement.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation of this sip, is to deal with the complexity of moving to a pull-price based system, given that settlement keepers are only compensated to update the price of the asset that is requested to be modified by a trader.
Dropping the event on reported debt would alleviate the need to update prices on all markets in a supermarket, without undue risk. 
Furthermore, requiring that prices on the collaterals in a super market be fresh, helps ensure that the collateral value in a supermarket is reliable, an important consideration  when drawing out liquidity from a supermarket.

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Pending

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Pending 

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Pending

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Pending

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
