## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:
- Drop the [`getReportedDebt`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L301) event emitted upon withdrawing sUSD from a given perp market
- Requiring that traders, upon committing to a new order, update the stale prices of all the collaterals configured in the super market where the order is sent to

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `getReportedDebt` line emitted in the event, requires that all the market prices, in a given supermarket, have updated prices (default staleness  tolerance). This can be problematic for large supermarkets, as the cost of updating the prices of many markets that don't exhibit much trading activity can be significant

- Upon settlement of a trade, the `getDepositedCollateralValue` function is called [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L300C24-L300C51) and [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L75). This function checks that all configured collaterals to a given perp super market have fresh prices (default staleness tolerance). In order to ensure that trade settlement keepers, continue to be properly incentivized to execute a pending order, the prices of collaterals need to be not stale

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation is to deal with the complexity of moving to a pull-price based system and given that settlement keepers are only paid to update prices that pertain to the position being modified by the trader.
Dropping the event on reported debt would alleviate the need to update prices on all markets in a supermarket, without undue risk (given that this is an event). Requiring that prices on collaterals in a super market is an acceptable alternative, given that only few highly liquid collaterals are expected to be configured in super markets.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Pending

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Pending 

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Pending

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Pending

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
