## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:
- Drop the [`getReportedDebt`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/dcba4ade51c893b7eda5f50657ba4e10dd435fa6/protocol/synthetix/contracts/modules/core/MarketManagerModule.sol#L301) from the event emitted upon withdrawing sUSD from a given perp market.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `getReportedDebt` function requires that all the market prices, in a given supermarket, be not stale. This can be problematic for large supermarkets, as the cost of updating the prices of many markets, that don't exhibit much trading activity, can be significant.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation of this sip, is to deal with the complexity of moving to a pull-price based system, given that settlement keepers are only compensated to update the price of the asset that is requested to be modified by a trader.
Dropping the event on reported debt would alleviate the need to update prices on all markets in a supermarket, without undue risk. 

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

Dropping 1 line from the event emitted.
